# Epic 2: LangGraph Orchestration & Multi-Agent Framework

## Epic Goal

Implement LangGraph stateful workflow orchestration with multi-agent coordination, enabling parallel execution, dynamic routing, and comprehensive agent management with background agent pool for automated task handling.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality**: BMAD agent personas (PM, Architect, Dev, QA) with step-through user interface and workflow execution
- **Technology stack**: BMAD-Method agent system, MCP tool registry, workflow state management
- **Integration points**: BMAD agent personas, workflow execution engine, MCP tool routing, state persistence

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed**: LangGraph StateGraph orchestration, multi-agent parallel execution, background agent pool, stateful context preservation
- **How it integrates**: BMAD agents as LangGraph nodes, stateful workflow orchestration, parallel execution with resource management
- **Success criteria**: Sub-2 second agent handoff times, 3x workflow speed improvement, 99.9% state persistence reliability

## Stories

### Story 2.1: LangGraph StateGraph Implementation
**Goal**: Implement LangGraph StateGraph for stateful workflow orchestration with persistent context across agent interactions

### Story 2.2: Multi-Agent Parallel Execution
**Goal**: Implement parallel execution for multi-agent workflows with dynamic routing and resource management

### Story 2.3: Background Agent Pool Implementation
**Goal**: Implement background agent pool for automated routine task handling while main agents focus on high-level decisions

## Integration Requirements

- Preserve all existing BMAD agent personas and workflows
- Implement stateful context preservation across agent interactions
- Enable parallel execution with resource management
- Provide comprehensive agent coordination and conflict resolution
- Maintain sub-2 second agent handoff times

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (BMAD agent personas preserved)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (state persistence)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (step-through user interface maintained)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (3x speed improvement achieved)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: State management complexity and agent coordination conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive state management testing, conflict resolution mechanisms, resource isolation
- **Rollback Plan**: State rollback procedures, agent coordination fallback, resource management rollback

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing
- ✅ Integration points working correctly
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately
- ✅ No regression in existing features
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met (3x speed improvement)
- ✅ State persistence reliability achieved (99.9%)
- ✅ Agent handoff times met (sub-2 seconds)

## Success Criteria

- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Stateful workflow orchestration operational
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Parallel execution with resource management
- **Background Agent Pool**: Automated routine task handling active
- **State Persistence**: 99.9% state persistence reliability
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second agent handoff times
- **Speed Improvement**: 3x workflow speed improvement through parallelization
- **Resource Management**: 99.9% resource allocation reliability
- **Agent Coordination**: Sub-500ms communication latency

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Epic 1 completed (BMAD Cloud Migration Foundation)
- **External Dependencies**: Redis for state persistence, LangGraph framework
- **Internal Dependencies**: BMAD agent personas, workflow execution engine, MCP tool routing

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Critical Path**: StateGraph → Parallel Execution → Background Agents
**Parallel Opportunities**: Background agent development can run parallel with parallel execution implementation
