# Epic 1: BMAD Cloud Migration Foundation

## Epic Goal

Migrate BMAD-Method from local installation to Cerebral cloud cluster while maintaining all existing functionality, integrating with new infrastructure (Sealed Secrets, Supabase, MinIO, OAuth2Proxy), and enabling cerebral tasks integration with multi-agent workflows.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality**: BMAD-Method running locally through `vendor/bmad/` directory with complete workflows, agents, templates, and user interface
- **Technology stack**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, MCP (Model Context Protocol), local ChromaDB, local file storage
- **Integration points**: MCP tool registry, direct client routing, vendor BMAD integration, local workflow execution

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed**: Cloud-native deployment of BMAD-Method with wrapper services, cloud database integration, cloud storage, and enhanced security
- **How it integrates**: Wrapper services around existing BMAD components with API/MCP transport, maintaining existing tool interface
- **Success criteria**: All existing BMAD functionality preserved, sub-5 second response times, 99.9% uptime, production-grade security compliance

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Infrastructure Setup and Connectivity
**Goal**: Establish cloud cluster infrastructure and basic connectivity for reliable cloud-based BMAD operations

### Story 1.2: MCP Tool Routing Implementation  
**Goal**: Implement cloud-based MCP tool routing with fallback mechanisms for seamless tool execution

### Story 1.3: Supabase Integration Setup
**Goal**: Set up Supabase integration for session management and workflow data storage

### Story 1.4: Vector Operations Implementation
**Goal**: Implement pgvector operations for similarity search and knowledge RAG operations

### Story 1.5: MinIO Storage Setup
**Goal**: Set up MinIO S3 integration for basic artifact storage and expansion packs

### Story 1.6: MinIO Artifact Management
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive artifact management with AWS S3 fallback

### Story 1.7: Cerebral Tasks Integration
**Goal**: Integrate cerebral tasks for multi-agent workflows and Plan→Implement→Test cycles

### Story 1.8: Cerebral Tasks Advanced Features
**Goal**: Implement advanced cerebral tasks features including parallel execution and recovery

### Story 1.9: Production Gate Implementation
**Goal**: Implement production gate system to prevent mock mode execution in production

### Story 1.10: End-to-End Testing and Validation
**Goal**: Validate complete cloud migration with comprehensive testing and performance validation

## Integration Requirements

- Maintain existing MCP tool interface compatibility
- Implement cloud resilience mechanisms (circuit breakers, retry logic, fallback)
- Ensure production-grade deployment with security compliance
- Provide comprehensive backup and restore procedures
- Enable parallel development after MCP routing establishment

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (MCP tool interface preserved)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (dual-write validation)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (BMAD agent personas maintained)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (sub-5 second response times maintained)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing BMAD functionality during cloud migration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, wrapper services architecture, local fallback mechanisms
- **Rollback Plan**: Automated rollback procedures, comprehensive backup and restore, feature flags

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing
- ✅ Integration points working correctly
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately
- ✅ No regression in existing features
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met or exceeded
- ✅ Security compliance validated
- ✅ Production deployment successful

## Success Criteria

- **BMAD Functionality**: All existing BMAD functionality preserved
- **Cloud Execution**: BMAD workflows execute successfully in cloud
- **API Integration**: MCP tools work seamlessly with cloud BMAD
- **Version Management**: Git-based deployment with versioning
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Tenant isolation and access control
- **Performance**: Sub-5 second response time for workflow initiation
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover
- **Security**: Kyverno policy compliance and security hardening

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Cerebral cloud cluster operational, OAuth2Proxy configured, Sealed Secrets Controller deployed
- **External Dependencies**: Supabase account, MinIO deployment, monitoring infrastructure
- **Internal Dependencies**: MCP tool registry, vendor BMAD integration, local development environment

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 weeks
**Critical Path**: Infrastructure → MCP Routing → Database → Storage → Tasks → Testing
**Parallel Opportunities**: MinIO setup can run parallel with Supabase integration
