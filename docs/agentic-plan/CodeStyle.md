## Code Style Guidelines

- Naming: descriptive, full words; functions as verbs, variables as nouns.
- Types: explicit on public APIs; avoid `any`‑like escape hatches.
- Control flow: guard clauses, handle errors first, limited nesting.
- Comments: explain why, not how; avoid TODOs—implement instead.
- Formatting: match project conventions; multiline for readability.
