---

Phase 0

- 0.1 CLI bootstrap: Verified
  - Evidence: public CLI present; agent loop entrypoint available; contracts tests pass.
  - Notes: provider selection and budgets tracked separately.

- 0.2 Model provider abstraction: Partial
  - Evidence: Docs updated; Cerebral Server noted; selection via env expected.
  - Issues: No explicit provider health tests; add readiness checks and unit tests.

- 0.3 Iteration budgets and restart heuristics: Partial
  - Evidence: Planned in tracker; not enforced yet in loop.
  - Next: implement time/step budgets and restart reasons; add tests.

---

Phase 1

- 1.1 testing.run_pytest: Verified
  - Evidence: pytest executor + parser tests pass.
  - Files: `cflow_platform/core/test_runner.py`, `cflow_platform/core/failure_parser.py`.

- 1.2 Failure parser and report synthesizer: Verified
  - Evidence: failure parsing tests pass.

- 1.3 Minimal edit applier: Partial
  - Evidence: module exists; not wired E2E; no safety tests.
  - Next: allowlist + rollback + dry‑run tests, wire into loop.

- 1.4 Lint/pre‑commit integration: Partial
  - Evidence: hooks present; not enforced inside loop.

- 1.5 Dry‑run edits + diff presentation: Partial
  - Evidence: planned only.

- 1.6 E2E seeded failing test to green: Blocked
  - Evidence: not implemented yet.

---

Phase 2

- 2.1 Instruction profiles loader: Partial
  - Evidence: guidance present; loader not implemented/tests missing.

- 2.2 code_reasoning.plan: Blocked
  - Evidence: tool not implemented; no tests.

---

Phase 3

- 3.1 sandbox.run_python: Blocked
  - Evidence: not implemented; policy/tests missing.

- 3.2 Context7 auto‑docs: Partial
  - Evidence: docs integration planned; not wired in loop.

- 3.3 Internet search MCP: Partial
  - Evidence: planned optional wiring; not present.

---

Phase 6

- 6.1 cflow-memory-check CLI: Partial
  - Evidence: CLI exists (`cflow_platform/cli/memory_check.py`).
  - Issues: Requires SUPABASE env to fully validate; add integration test with test project.

- 6.2 Migrations & schemas: Partial
  - Evidence: `docs/agentic-plan/sql/001_memory_schema.sql`; `DatabaseSchema.md` updated for `knowledge_*`.
  - Issues: RPC `search_agentic_embeddings` not included in SQL file; add migration; add RLS indices.

- 6.3 Dual‑write pipeline: Partial
  - Evidence: `vendor/cerebral/services/chromadb_supabase_sync_service.py` implements add/search with fallback.
  - Issues: Needs end‑to‑end test + Supabase write/read probe; real-time emit optional.

- 6.4 Filesystem ingestion (Cursor artifacts): Blocked
  - Evidence: not implemented.

- 6.5 Request routing prefer CerebralMemory: Partial
  - Evidence: memory API present; loop not calling memory first by default.

---

Phase 7

- 7.1/7.2/7.3 Sub‑agents & orchestration: Blocked
  - Evidence: planned only.

---

Phase 9

- 9.1/9.2 Budgets & restarts: Partial
  - Evidence: planned; not enforced; no tests.

---

Phase 5

- 5.x Platform integration & docs: Partial
  - Evidence: agentic-plan docs updated; telemetry hooks not added.

---

Phase 8

- 8.x Post‑run updates & auto‑commit: Partial
  - Evidence: not implemented; requires `core/git_ops.py` and gating.

---

Phase 4 (Optional)

- 4.x Optional packs: N/A
  - Evidence: not needed on Cerebral cluster; leave for portability.

---

Phase 10

- 10.1 Apple Silicon MPS default/fallback: Partial
  - Evidence: embeddings smoke test passes; default selection enforcement not validated.

- 10.2 Record model/dims; SLOs; dims enforcement: Partial
  - Evidence: dims normalization present in sync service; SLOs not tested.
