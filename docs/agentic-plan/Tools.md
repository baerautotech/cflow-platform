## Tool Definitions

- testing.run_pytest: executes pytest with size caps, returns structured JSON (status, summary, logs?)
- code_reasoning.plan (planned): returns bounded steps with success checks
- sandbox.run_python (planned): sandboxed code execution with CPU/mem/time caps, no network
- memory_add / memory_search (planned integration): prefer CerebralMemory first
