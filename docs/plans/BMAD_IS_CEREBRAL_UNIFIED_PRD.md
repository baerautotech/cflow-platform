- **Business Cost**: Forced to use inferior development tools, reducing efficiency

#### **3. No Parallel Processing**
- **Problem**: Story shards processed sequentially, creating bottlenecks
- **Impact**: Development velocity limited by single-threaded execution
- **Business Cost**: Slower time-to-market for platform features

#### **4. Fragmented Plan Management**
- **Problem**: Multiple conflicting implementation plans create confusion
- **Impact**: Development teams work on conflicting priorities
- **Business Cost**: Wasted effort and delayed delivery

#### **5. Limited HIL Integration**
- **Problem**: Human decisions not properly integrated into automated workflows
