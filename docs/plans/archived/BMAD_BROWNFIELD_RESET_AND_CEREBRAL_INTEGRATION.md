# BMAD Brownfield Reset and Cerebral Integration Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-21  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Brownfield Reset Phase  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Core Vision Restoration  

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

We have identified a critical divergence from the original vision: **`@BMAD-master` should BECOME Cerebral itself**, not just provide MCP tools alongside it. We have multiple conflicting implementation plans, competing code implementations, and have lost sight of the core architectural vision.

This brownfield reset plan consolidates all existing work, eliminates conflicts, and creates a unified path forward where BMAD Master becomes the central orchestration system for the entire Cerebral platform.

- `tool_registry.py` (3 functions, 1 class, 12,294 chars)

### **3. Missing Core Functionality**
1. **BMAD Master as Cerebral Core** (not just MCP tools)
2. **Unified persona activation system**
3. **Project Management integration**
4. **Plan conflict detection and resolution**
5. **HIL-enabled plan enhancement vs new plan creation**
6. **Voice control systems integration**
7. **Comprehensive story shard management**

## üîÑ **HIL-ENABLED DECISION FRAMEWORK**

### **Plan Enhancement vs New Plan Creation**
When making changes to existing plans, the HIL system should:

1. **Analyze the scope of changes**
   - Minor updates ‚Üí Enhance existing plan
   - Major architectural changes ‚Üí Create new plan
   - Conflicting requirements ‚Üí Flag for HIL decision

2. **Present decision options to user:**
   - Enhance existing plan with change summary
   - Create new plan with migration path
   - Hybrid approach with plan versioning

3. **Track decision rationale:**
   - Document why enhancement vs new plan was chosen
   - Maintain decision history for future reference
   - Update conflict detection rules based on decisions

### **Conflict Resolution Process**
1. **Automatic detection** of plan conflicts
2. **HIL presentation** of conflict options
3. **User decision** with rationale capture
4. **Implementation** of chosen resolution
5. **Validation** of resolution effectiveness
