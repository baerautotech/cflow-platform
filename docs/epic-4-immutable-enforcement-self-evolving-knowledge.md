# Epic 4: Immutable Enforcement & Self-Evolving Knowledge

## Epic Goal

Implement immutable pre-commit/post-commit enforcement system with self-evolving knowledge graph capabilities, ensuring code quality, preventing mock mode, and enabling automatic template evolution based on successful patterns.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality**: BMAD workflow execution, template system, knowledge management, code quality processes
- **Technology stack**: Git hooks, BMAD template system, Supabase + pgvector, knowledge graph
- **Integration points**: Git workflow, BMAD templates, knowledge graph, documentation system

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed**: Immutable pre-commit hooks, automatic post-commit knowledge sync, pattern recognition, template evolution, documentation automation
- **How it integrates**: Hardcoded git hooks, Supabase + pgvector integration, BMAD template evolution, comprehensive documentation
- **Success criteria**: 100% compliance enforcement, 99.9% knowledge sync reliability, 95% pattern recognition accuracy, 90% documentation semantic accuracy

## Stories

### Story 4.1: Immutable Pre-Commit Enforcement System
**Goal**: Implement immutable pre-commit enforcement with hardcoded git hooks for BMAD workflow compliance and code quality validation

### Story 4.2: Post-Commit Knowledge Sync System
**Goal**: Implement automatic post-commit knowledge graph synchronization with comprehensive documentation generation

### Story 4.3: Self-Evolving Knowledge System
**Goal**: Implement self-evolving knowledge system with pattern recognition and automatic template evolution

## Integration Requirements

- Deploy hardcoded git hooks that cannot be bypassed
- Implement comprehensive pre-commit validation (Ruff, Bandit, Semgrep, Trivy)
- Enable automatic post-commit knowledge sync to Supabase + pgvector
- Provide pattern recognition with 95% accuracy
- Generate comprehensive documentation within 60 seconds of commit

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (BMAD template system preserved)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (knowledge graph)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (BMAD workflows maintained)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (60 second documentation generation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Pre-commit bypass and knowledge sync failures
- **Mitigation**: Hardcoded enforcement mechanisms, automated retry mechanisms, comprehensive validation
- **Rollback Plan**: Git hook rollback, knowledge sync rollback, template evolution rollback

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing
- ✅ Integration points working correctly
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately
- ✅ No regression in existing features
- ✅ Compliance enforcement achieved (100%)
- ✅ Knowledge sync reliability achieved (99.9%)
- ✅ Pattern recognition accuracy achieved (95%)

## Success Criteria

- **Pre-Commit Enforcement**: Immutable pre-commit hooks deployed
- **Post-Commit Sync**: Automatic knowledge sync operational
- **Self-Evolution**: Pattern recognition and template evolution active
- **Documentation Automation**: Comprehensive documentation generation
- **Pre-Commit Compliance**: 100% compliance enforcement
- **Knowledge Sync Reliability**: 99.9% sync reliability
- **Pattern Recognition Accuracy**: Above 95% accuracy
- **Documentation Semantic Accuracy**: Above 90% accuracy
- **Template Evolution**: Automatic template improvement based on patterns
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Knowledge transfer between projects

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Epic 3 completed (Multi-Purpose Developer Agent & Output Framework)
- **External Dependencies**: Git hooks, Supabase + pgvector, validation tools (Ruff, Bandit, Semgrep, Trivy)
- **Internal Dependencies**: BMAD template system, knowledge graph, documentation system

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Critical Path**: Pre-Commit Enforcement → Knowledge Sync → Self-Evolution
**Parallel Opportunities**: Knowledge sync development can run parallel with pre-commit enforcement

**Epic Status**: Ready for Story Development
**Next Phase**: Production Deployment and Enterprise Integration
