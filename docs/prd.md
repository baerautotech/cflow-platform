# BMAD Cloud Migration Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis with comprehensive architectural context from BMAD-Master's contextual update

**Current Project State**: 
The cflow-platform is a Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI agents with access to development tools and workflows. It currently integrates with local vendor BMAD workflows (`vendor/bmad/`) and needs to migrate to cloud-based execution on the Cerebral cluster. The platform serves as a bridge between AI agents and development tools, with 50+ MCP tools for system operations, task management, memory, and code intelligence.

- ✅ Technology Stack Upgrade (Local → Cloud migration)
- ✅ Performance/Scalability Improvements (Cloud-based execution)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Migrate BMAD-Method from local installation (`vendor/bmad/`) to the Cerebral cloud cluster, enabling cloud-based workflow execution while maintaining all existing functionality and ensuring production-grade deployment with enhanced infrastructure including Sealed Secrets + Standard Kubernetes Secrets, Supabase + pgvector storage, OAuth2Proxy authentication, cerebral tasks integration, and comprehensive LangChain/LangGraph orchestration with immutable pre-commit/post-commit enforcement, self-evolving knowledge graph capabilities, and a multi-purpose Developer Agent framework for analysis and output generation across varied data sources and human-consumable deliverables.

**Impact Assessment**:
- ✅ Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Migrate BMAD workflows to cloud cluster for scalability
- Maintain all existing BMAD functionality during migration
- Integrate with new infrastructure (Sealed Secrets, Supabase, MinIO, OAuth2Proxy)
- Enable cerebral tasks integration with multi-agent workflows
- Ensure production-grade deployment with security compliance
- Provide seamless MCP tool routing to cloud services
- Implement LangChain/LangGraph stateful workflow orchestration
- Deploy immutable pre-commit/post-commit enforcement system
- Enable self-evolving knowledge graph with pattern recognition
- Create comprehensive documentation automation and template evolution
- Transform Developer Agent into multi-purpose analysis and output framework
- Enable data analysis from varied sources with human-consumable deliverables
- Implement template and expansion pack system for reusable analysis/output

**Background Context**:
The cflow-platform currently runs BMAD workflows locally through the `vendor/bmad/` directory, but the infrastructure has undergone major changes including Vault→Sealed Secrets migration, vector/RDB→Supabase/MinIO migration, enhanced monitoring, and full cerebral tasks integration. Additionally, research has revealed the need for LangChain/LangGraph integration to provide stateful workflow orchestration, immutable pre-commit/post-commit enforcement to prevent mock mode and ensure code quality, and self-evolving knowledge graph capabilities that grow smarter with each project. The Developer Agent evolution from simple coding to a comprehensive analysis and output framework will enable data analysis from varied sources (APIs, databases, files, web sources) with human-consumable deliverables (reports, presentations, websites, dashboards). The platform needs to migrate to the cloud cluster to leverage these new capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring production-grade execution with comprehensive automation and self-improvement capabilities.

3. Knowledge sync reliability achieves 99.9% target with retry mechanisms
4. Semantic accuracy of generated documentation exceeds 90%
5. Complete audit trail is maintained for all knowledge sync operations

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: All commits trigger automatic knowledge graph updates
- **IV2**: Generated documentation maintains semantic accuracy above 90%
- **IV3**: Knowledge sync failures are automatically retried and logged

### Story 4.3: Self-Evolving Knowledge System

As a system engineer,
I want to implement a self-evolving knowledge system with pattern recognition,
so that BMAD templates and agent capabilities automatically improve based on successful implementation patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pattern recognition system identifies successful implementation patterns
2. BMAD templates automatically evolve based on learned patterns
3. Agent capabilities enhance over time with measurable improvement
4. Pattern recognition accuracy exceeds 95%
5. Cross-project learning enables knowledge transfer between projects

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Templates evolve based on successful patterns
- **IV2**: Agent capabilities improve measurably over time
- **IV3**: Pattern recognition accuracy meets requirements
