## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 1, so no previous story context exists.

### Brownfield Assessment Context
**Current Deployed Infrastructure (Based on Architecture Documentation):**
- **BMAD-API Service**: `bmad-api-fixed` deployment exists in cerebral-alpha namespace
- **WebMCP Server**: `webmcp-deployment` running on `mcp.cerebral.baerautotech.com`
- **Knowledge-RAG Service**: `knowledge-rag-development` deployed for Supabase integration
