## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 1, so no previous story context exists.

### Brownfield Assessment Context
**Current Deployed Infrastructure (Based on Architecture Documentation):**
- **BMAD-API Service**: `bmad-api-fixed` deployment exists in cerebral-alpha namespace
- **WebMCP Server**: `webmcp-deployment` running on `mcp.cerebral.baerautotech.com`
- **Knowledge-RAG Service**: `knowledge-rag-development` deployed for Supabase integration
- **Redis Deployment**: `redis-deployment` for caching and sessions
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Multiple deployment files exist in `infrastructure/kubernetes/`

**Architecture Claims vs. Reality Assessment:**
- **Architecture docs claim**: "COMPLETED" cluster deployment tasks
- **Reality check needed**: Validate what's actually deployed and working
- **Focus**: Enhance existing deployments rather than create new ones
- **Approach**: Assess current state, identify gaps, implement enhancements
