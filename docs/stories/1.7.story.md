### Brownfield Assessment Context
**Current Deployed Cerebral Tasks (Based on Architecture Documentation):**
- **Cerebral Tasks System**: Operational with cerebral_tasks table and basic task management
- **Multi-Agent Components**: PlanAgent, ImplementAgent, TestAgent with basic orchestration
- **Task Management**: Basic task lifecycle, status tracking, and dependency management
- **BMAD Integration**: Basic integration with BMAD workflows and story execution

**Architecture Claims vs. Reality Assessment:**
- **Architecture docs claim**: Cerebral tasks system operational with multi-agent workflows
- **Reality check needed**: Validate existing task orchestration, agent coordination, and workflow performance
- **Focus**: Enhance existing cerebral tasks rather than build new task management system
- **Approach**: Assess current functionality, identify workflow gaps, implement optimizations

### Data Models

**Plan→Implement→Test Cycle:**
- Pull local context and recent memory items (prefer CerebralMemory before external RAG) [Source: docs/agentic-plan/AgenticWorkflow.md]

- Plan minimal edits (bounded steps, SRP) with explicit success checks
- Apply edits (dry-run or write) using minimal edit applier with allowlist + rollback
- Lint/pre-commit integration with fail-closed before re-testing
- Re-run tests; if green, checkpoint and optionally auto-commit; otherwise iterate with budgets
