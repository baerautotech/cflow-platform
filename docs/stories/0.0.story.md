## Dev Notes

### Assessment Scope and Context
**Current System Overview:**
Based on architecture documentation, the BMAD cloud migration system includes:
- **WebMCP Server**: Running on `mcp.cerebral.baerautotech.com` with dual transport (STDIO + HTTP)
- **BMAD HTTP API Facade**: Deployed to cerebral cluster with comprehensive endpoints
- **Tool Registry**: Imported from `cflow_platform.core.tool_registry` with 50+ tools
