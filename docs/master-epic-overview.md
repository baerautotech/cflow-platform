## Project Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff**: "Please develop detailed user stories for Epic 1: BMAD Cloud Migration Foundation. Key considerations:

- This is a comprehensive cloud migration of an existing BMAD-Method system
- Integration points: MCP tool registry, vendor BMAD integration, Supabase, MinIO
- Existing patterns to follow: BMAD agent personas, workflow execution, template system
- Critical compatibility requirements: MCP tool interface, BMAD functionality, performance
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering cloud-native BMAD execution with enhanced capabilities."
