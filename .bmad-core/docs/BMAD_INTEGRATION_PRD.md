# BMAD Integration into cflow Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Make BMAD-METHOD (MIT) the authoritative planning/PM/story core of the Cerebral platform
- Replace existing planning systems with BMAD's agentic planning and context-engineered development methodology
- Enforce mandatory quality gates before codegen initiation to prevent premature development
- Integrate BMAD artifacts into Cerebral's RAG/KG and PM systems for comprehensive context management
- Provide comprehensive brownfield vs greenfield project type detection and workflow routing
- Implement Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) approval processes with interactive components
- Enable multi-user cluster deployment with team collaboration capabilities
- Integrate AI-powered planning optimization and collaborative planning intelligence
- Provide advanced project type intelligence with automatic complexity assessment
- Create interactive planning experiences with gamification and visualization
- Implement voice-controlled planning sessions for hands-free operation
- Provide automated planning compliance checking and architecture pattern verification
- Integrate advanced elicitation system with 10 structured brainstorming actions
- Implement technical preferences system for personalized agent recommendations
- Deploy sophisticated template processing system with AI-only processing directives

### Background Context
The Cerebral platform currently suffers from planning inconsistency and context loss that reduces code quality and increases rework. Existing flows allow codegen to start before PRD/Architecture/Story are sufficiently complete, leading to suboptimal outcomes. The integration of BMAD-METHOD will provide a unified, AI-assisted planning methodology that enforces quality gates and maintains context throughout the development lifecycle.

This integration addresses the critical need for standardized planning processes across all project types while supporting both individual developers and team collaboration. The solution leverages BMAD's proven methodology while adapting it to the platform's multi-user cluster environment and existing infrastructure.
