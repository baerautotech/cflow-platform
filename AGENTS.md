# Agents

This workspace uses Cursorâ€™s modular configuration.

- Root instructions live here (AGENTS.md)
- Structured rules live under .cursor/rules/
- Iteration/progress docs live as .mdc files under docs/
- Reusable actions live under commands/

All artifacts are mirrored into CerebralMemory for RAG retrieval.
